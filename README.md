   🌿 Blue Carbon MRV System

A full-stack digital platform for verifying mangrove & seagrass restoration using AI image analysis, geo-tagging, multi-role verification, and a transparent carbon credit registry.

🚀 Overview

Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves and seagrass are powerful blue carbon sinks, storing up to 10× more carbon than terrestrial forests. However, restoration efforts in India and other regions lack a transparent, community-accessible monitoring and verification system.

This project solves that gap by building an end-to-end MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) platform that:

Collects geo-tagged restoration evidence

Uses AI (Gemini API) for vegetation verification

Enables NGO + Government approval workflows

Maintains a tamper-proof registry

Converts verified data into tokenized carbon credits

Allows corporates to view & purchase credits

Provides income opportunities for coastal communities

Built for hackathons, academic evaluation, and real-world pilot testing.
